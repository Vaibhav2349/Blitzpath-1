                Research says that over 70% customers don’t want to pick up a
                phone and seek support. Rather getting asynchronous response on

                between customers looking for right solution with self help
                options and support resources who are spending few hours of
                their free time from busy schedule of work and personal life in
                helping such customers. Our clients have brought their cost of
                support down up to 60% without compromising on customer
                experience.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the next generation workforce
                which will help in biggest automation across the industry. While
                the technology claims 80%+ accuracy in predictive analytics, it
                needs significant effort to prepare training data, testing and
                make machine learn. Blitzpath has demonstrated repeated success
                with such assignments at global level. We not only bring
                functional expertise in these areas but own end-to-end process
                of data interpretation. Annotation is just one example in case
                of a Chatbot development. We played a pivotal role in developing
                training data for ChatBot development for a global car rental
                company by annotating their conversation data with customers.
